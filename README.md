# New Year Countdown:

This is a simple web application that displays a countdown timer to the year 2025 . It also allows users to select a specific U.S. time zone to view the countdown in their local time. I originally built it as a 2024 December Code Challenge at TripleTen software developer school.

## Key Features include:

- ⏱️ **Countdown Timer:** Counts down the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until January 1st, 2025.
- 😀 **User-Friendly Interface:** Displays the countdown in a clear and easy-to-understand format for users.
- 🌐 **Interactive Timezone Selection:** Allows users to choose between Eastern Time, Central Time, Mountain Time, and Pacific Time for a personalized countdown experience.
- 🎉 **Festive Decorations:** Includes festive seasonal decorations to add a touch of cheer to the countdown experience.

## Technologies and Tools Used:

- 💻 **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):** The foundation of the web page, used to structure the content and layout.
- 🎨 **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Used to style the web page, controlling the visual appearance of the countdown timer, layout, and festive decorations.
- 📱 **Responsive Design:** Ensures the web page adapts and displays optimally across different devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Next Steps for the 2026 countdown:

I plan to develop this project further by refactoring the code into componenets using react. Feel free to fork the code and make it your own!
