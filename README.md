# New Year Countdown!

This is a simple web application that displays a countdown timer to the year 2025. It also allows users to select a specific U.S. time zone to view the countdown in their local time. I built it as December Code Challenge at TripleTen.

# Key Features include:

Counts down the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until January 1st, 2025.
Displays the countdown in a user-friendly format.
Allows users to choose between Eastern Time, Central Time, Mountain Time, and Pacific Time.
Includes festive seasonal decorations.
